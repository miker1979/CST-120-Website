# CST-120 Website Project

## Overview

This repository contains my CST-120 course website developed as part of my Introduction to Web Development coursework at Grand Canyon University. The site was built using foundational web technologies and published using GitHub Pages to demonstrate my ability to design, structure, and deploy a functional website.

The purpose of this project was to practice creating webpages, linking content, organizing files, and applying basic styling while following course assignment requirements.
